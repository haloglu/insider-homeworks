# Fetch API User List with LocalStorage 🌍

This assignment focuses on **retrieving user data from an external API**, storing the data in **localStorage**, and dynamically updating the UI.

## 📌 Objectives

- Use the **Fetch API** to retrieve user data from an external API endpoint.
- Store the retrieved data in **localStorage** to ensure persistence.
- Display the user data dynamically, including:
  - **Full Name**
  - **Email Address**
  - **Address Details**
- Implement **error handling** to manage API failures gracefully.
- Provide a **delete option** to remove stored users from localStorage and UI (optional).

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Covered

✔ **Fetch API** → Handling API requests asynchronously  
✔ **localStorage** → Storing and retrieving data efficiently  
✔ **JavaScript & DOM Manipulation** → Dynamically rendering API data  
✔ **Error Handling** → Managing API response failures

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

By completing this assignment, participants will enhance their skills in **API consumption, client-side data management, and building dynamic UI components based on fetched data**.

🚀 Develop a user list that seamlessly integrates API data with persistent storage!
