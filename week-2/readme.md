# Week 2 - JavaScript Logic & Algorithms 🔢

This week focuses on **JavaScript fundamentals, object manipulation, algorithmic problem-solving, and event-driven programming**.  
The assignments cover the use of **objects, arrays, functions, and algorithms** to develop dynamic, interactive, and efficient web applications.

## 📌 Assignments Overview

- 🛒 **[User & Shopping Cart Object](../week-2/homework-1-user-shopping-cart/)** → Collect user input, manage a shopping cart, and calculate the total price using JavaScript objects and arrays.
- 🔢 **[Longest Collatz Sequence](../week-2/homework-2-longest-collatz-sequence/)** → Implement an algorithm to solve and optimize the Collatz Sequence problem.
- ⏳ **[Countdown Timer](../week-2/homework-3-countdown-timer/)** → Develop an interactive countdown timer with start and reset functionality.

## 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Covered

✔ **JavaScript ES6+** → Objects, arrays, functions, and event handling  
✔ **Algorithmic Thinking** → Problem-solving using loops, conditions, and recursion  
✔ **DOM Manipulation** → Handling user input and updating UI dynamically

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

By the end of this week, participants will gain **a deeper understanding of JavaScript’s core principles, algorithmic efficiency, and real-world application scenarios**.
